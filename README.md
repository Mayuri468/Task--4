Task 4: Multi-Step User Registration Form with Avatar Upload
This task implements a multi-step user registration form in React. The form is split across three steps:

Step 1 – Collects basic user information: name and email.

Step 2 – Collects the user's password.

Step 3 – Allows the user to upload a profile avatar (image preview included).


Key Features:

Navigation between steps using "Next" and "Back" buttons.

Input validation for required fields.

Avatar image preview before submission.

Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.

Final form submission displays form data in the console.

This component demonstrates controlled form handling, image upload preview, and multi-step navigation logic in a React application.
